===================================================
|| ESPN League Login System & League Data Access ||
===================================================
What It Does Well
Secure Login via ESPN
    Users log into their ESPN account one time through a secure browser window. 
    We never store their password.

Pulls All League Info Automatically
    After login, we grab all key league data: 
      matchups, scores, rosters, team names, and standings.

Works Across Past & Current Seasons
    We can load historical seasons (e.g., 2024) 
    or pull new data live each week during the season.

No Manual Data Entry Needed
    Once linked, users don’t need to input league IDs or copy-paste anything.
==============================
|| What It Doesn’t Do (Yet) ||
==============================
Not a Permanent Link
    ESPN cookies eventually expire (typically 2–4 weeks), 
      so users will occasionally need to reconnect their account to keep things synced.

Doesn’t Push to ESPN
    This setup only reads data from ESPN—it 
    doesn’t post or modify anything in the user's account.

Not Officially Supported by ESPN
    While many sites do this, 
    ESPN could change its systems and break our flow, 
    so we’re always monitoring for changes.
